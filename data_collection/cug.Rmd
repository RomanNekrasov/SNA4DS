This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*.

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### Load data
edges <- read.csv("edge_df.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
vertices <- read.csv("vertex_df_icounts.csv", header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

### Removing the youtube#commentThreads only keeping the "youtube#comment"s
edges <- edges[edges$kind != 'youtube#commentThread', ]

### Renaming the columns to sender and receiver
names(edges)[names(edges)=='author_id'] <- 'sender'
names(edges)[names(edges)=='dest_id'] <- 'receiver'

###  Rearranging columns to make 'sender' and 'receiver' the first two columns
###  this is required for the igraph function to create the graph object
edges <- edges[c("sender", "receiver", setdiff(names(edges), c("sender", "receiver")))]

result <- data.frame()

### Concat
# edges$senderreceiver <- paste(edges$sender, edges$receiver)
# edges <- edges[!duplicated(edges$senderreceiver), ]  # Removing duplicates
# edges$senderreceiver <- NULL

### handling NA values
edges <- edges[edges$sender != 'nan', ]
edges <- edges[edges$sender != '', ]
edges <- edges[edges$receiver != 'nan', ]
edges <- edges[edges$receiver != '', ]

### Creating graph object
graph <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE, vertices = vertices)
graph <- snafun::remove_isolates(graph)
# suppressWarnings({
# graph <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(edges, directed = TRUE) |>
#   snafun::remove_loops() |>
#   snafun::remove_vertices(vertices = "NA")
# })
```

```{r}

# Obtain the edge list of the graph

# Identify duplicate edges
duplicate_edges <- duplicated(edge_list) | duplicated(edge_list, fromLast = TRUE)

# Filter out the duplicate edges
unique_edge_list <- edge_list[!duplicate_edges, ]

# Create a new igraph object with the unique edges
unique_graph <- igraph::graph_from_edgelist(unique_edge_list, directed = igraph::is.directed(graph))
