o Combine two or more existing datasets (max 0.5 bonus points)

o Scrape or collect your own data (max. 1 bonus point)

-   Clearly explain where the data is coming from:

o Who collected the data?

o What is the source?

o When was the data produced?

o How was the data collected?

-   Provide descriptive measures of your data (tables, plots, etc.)

-   Why is this data useful to study your topic and answer your research questions?
